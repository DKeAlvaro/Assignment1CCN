# Assignment1CCN
In this assignment we created a genetic algorithm that simulates a simplified version of the infinite monkey theorem. It simulates the process of evolution in a much shorter time.
Starting from a random set of strings our goal is to evolve them to some desired sentence or word, in this case “Hello World”.
We implemented all of our code in Java, by making use of our knowledge in object oriented programming and populations and genetics.
The goal of this assignment is to have a better understanding of how natural selection works throughout programming.
